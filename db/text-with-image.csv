It is a wildlife sanctuary that includes beaches and coastal habitats. Although I grew up in MA, this is not a place I have visited often. My friend and I went on Sunday - a beautiful, hot and sunny day.<strong> We wore masks in her car and had the windows open. We hiked around wearing masks.</strong> Much of Plum Island is closed off to the public, but sections of the beach are open. We had lunch in one of these sections, sitting 6 feet apart, unmasked.

If so, give some examples of what feels different.","<strong> Yes, this time of year does feel different this year.</strong> I love summer and am always sad to see summer end and autumn begin.

Last fall I did a lot of hiking in NH with my friend and my dog, Teddy. We decided to tackle 4000 footers, an awesome undertaking, and hiked 4 of them. The picture above is from our 2nd 4000 footer, and really captures some of the beautiful fall scenery we saw. We had fun in spite of the really hard work, and felt proud of our accomplishment. There was a sense of freedom and adventure that we could take for granted.

<strong>This year, I don't feel a sense of freedom and adventure. I feel much more apprehension and worry.</strong> I am worried about a second wave of the Corona virus hitting. I am worried about another quarantine. I wonder what it will be like facing all of this as winter approaches. At least when this all started, there was summer to look forward to. I worry about not being able to have social distance gatherings as it gets cold.

<strong>I am also really worried about the upcoming election.</strong> I was horrified when our current president won 4 years ago, and can't imagine what 4 more years might look like. I am also worried at the distrust and confusion that has been created about the upcoming election and voting. There is so much confusion!

I never look forward to the end of summer and this year, I am anticipating fall and winter with much more dread than usual. I certainly don't have the sense of fun and adventure that was so present last year. ",2020-09-02 17:38:04,true,2020-09-03 02:43:42.036278,en,PJP_1003_1_EN_week14_journal_2_ptext.JPG

I am still on pins and needles waiting for the outcome of this.  I found a recipe for an Election Cake - pictured above - in the NYT's on Tuesday, and made it while watching the returns on Tuesday night.  Baking this cake, concentrating on the directions, reading about its history, etc, helped me to manage my anxiety last night.  Fortunately it is delicious - like a sweet cinnamon raisin bread.  A new Election tradition in our house!  

     I must admit that I am also shocked that the president has done so well.  Given how poorly he has handled the pandemic, not to mention so many other things,  I figured he wouldn't come close to winning.  I truly hope that Biden wins.  However, whatever the outcome - Biden, please!! - we need to reflect as a country on what all of the votes for the president mean.

true,true,photo_and_text,"How is the coronavirus pandemic affecting your life right now?

This week the pandemic primarily impacted Thanksgiving, and how we decided to celebrate the holiday.</strong> My husband and I just finished our Thanksgiving dinner for 2. We spent the day preparing it, and really enjoyed ourselves. I must admit, we were pleased with how it turned out.

I was also reflecting on last Thanksgiving and how different this year is.<strong> Last year we hosted 13 people and 3 dogs. Our house was full of people, dogs and good cheer.</strong> We have a video of everyone at the table, busy talking and laughing. It was a truly wonderful and memorable day. This day was memorable, too, in a much smaller and quieter way. I do look forward to celebrating Thanksgiving again with our extended family, especially our children. However,<strong> I feel like we made the best of the situation this year, staying safe and keeping others safe, as well.</strong>

<strong> One last note. I really missed my father today. He died 2 months ago. Although we didn't spend Thanksgiving with him since my mother died 7 years ago, I always spoke to him on Thanksgiving and we exchanged cooking tips</strong> and how the food came out. He was a really difficult person who could become enraged very quickly. I do not miss that part of him at all. However, when engaged around food and cooking, we could have nice conversations, especially when he was sharing tips with me. He made the best stuffing ever - pictured above. He always added apples, raisins and nuts. I hadn't had it in a long time but I found the recipe he dictated to me about 1 year after my mother died. <strong> I followed his recipe today, and it was almost as good as his It felt like a little bit of his good side was with us today.</strong>",2020-11-26 22:32:37,true,2020-11-27 15:22:16.169216,en,PJP_1003_1_EN_week26_journal_1_ptext.JPG
true,true,photo_and_text,Talk about how the events of recent months have affected either your work or your ability to work.,"Although I am still working full time, my job has been significantly impacted by COVID 19. I am a social worker who has my own practice, mainly seeing young adults and adults, particularly new moms, in an office that I rent. On 3/13, Governor Baker declared a State of Emergency for MA. At that time I needed to scramble to get a platform from which I could conduct counseling through tele-health. Shortly after the State of Emergency, Baker announced that all insurances operating in MA needed to reimburse tele-health at the same rate that in person visits are reimbursed, paving the way for health services, including mental health, to continue.

Not being particularly adept at technology, getting a healthcare platform up and running was really challenging. ...
Most of my clients chose to continue to meet with me virtually, although a few opted out for the time being.There were some snafus in the beginning, primarily due to weak internet, such as the sessions freezing so I was missing actual content of what people were saying, not being able to hear or sometimes see clients, etc. ...
I greatly prefer working from home. The picture included above shows the view of the little desk I work from looking into my back yard, and most importantly, our cat Zelda who is a frequent companion while I am working. My dog sometimes visits, which is also fun for me, and I believe my clients, who have asked to meet him. I like the extra time working from home has created in each day, allowing time for more cooking, yoga, reading, seeing our pets and my husband.

There are many unknowns, however - should I keep my office, which I am still paying rent for and not using? If I decide to go back to my office, when will it be safe to see clients, protecting their health and my own? Will insurances continue to cover tele-health after the pandemic subsides? If not, or at a reduced rate like pre-pandemic, would I make enough money to help pay the bills? Would my clients want to continue through tele-health, or would I lose most of them? Etc, etc. ...",2020-07-01 16:33:11,true,2020-07-06 21:03:17.082736,en,PJP_1003_1_EN_week5_journal_2_ptext.jpg

Not being able to go to school, and parents doing homeschooling has affected the lives of my children and grandchildren. I have faith that my grandchildren will be able to eventually catch up on their schooling.  Other children won't be able to.I worry about this a lot. 

At this point in the evil pandemic, no one knows when children all over the world will be able to return to school. This is a problem that will be talked about and written about for perhaps endless years.

Did people write about how children were affected educationally after the Spanish Flu of 1918-1919? Where is that information?I can't find it.

I remember Hugh Downs on a tv show” Over Easy” asking elderly why they were growing bonsais when bonsai take decades & even century to grow. “ It gives us hope”, was the answer.

<strong> Gardening is an act of faith and hope. It can sustain you physically and spiritually-and keeps you out of stores if it is successful.</strong>

I was looking at consolidating my garden and not thinking about composting in it when I purchased it. Now I’m excited to trim my vegetables and add to the compost so my worms have food to make compost tea, which gives my plants nutrients. This has been great so far . I’m eating more vegetables, growing future vegetables as well as herbs and flowers & enjoying watching things leaf out. I bought a 2nd tower and spent time setting it up and transplanting basil and poppies into it today. I planted some seeds, too.

<strong> Growing things is exciting. You get to see and be a part of change</strong>. In addition to hope it gives agency and is fun.

true,true,photo_and_text,"How is the coronavirus pandemic affecting your life right now? Tell us about your experiences, feelings, and thoughts.","<strong>Christmas Eve 2019 was such fun!</strong>

<strong>I’d traveled across center city Philadelphia and attended an aqua aerobics class</strong> @ the Logan Hotel on the Parkway.<strong> I met my friend Liz there </strong>and we traveled back through town together. I don’t ’t recall whether we ate lunch together as we often did on Tuesdays and Thursdays after class; probably not, as it was Christmas Eve & lots to accomplish.

We parted @ city Hall and she took a subway south to get to her home.

<strong>I walked back </strong>to check out a cloak for my daughter and purchase leggings from a Christmas Village vendor outside of city Hall. <strong>A young black woman tapped me in my shoulder </strong>& I turned to see her. <strong>We laughed: we were wearing the same furry coat. “You’re my sister from another mother,” I said. We laughed and parted. </strong>I rounded city hall

and cut through <strong>the former John Wanamaker store </strong>& took this photo.

<strong>The store was a fixture in Philadelphia. </strong>John Wanamaker started the department store. He was a devout Christian-I have a hymnal he wrote and a mug from its last days as Wanamakers. He installed a large organ and sometimes there are concerts. <strong>In the center of the first floor is a giant sculpture of a bronze eagle. “meet me @ the eagle” were directions for meeting up in the days before cellphones, </strong>days when you needed a fix point and some estimate of a timeto meet.

The mayor, Ed Rendell had signed my shopping bag “ a day that will live in infamy” with the date as I was one of the last to exit it as Wanamakers. He had a special affection for Wanamakers -he and wife Midge got their first credit cards there when they were students @ Penn in the 60’s.

It closed & became a Lord and Taylor, then a Macy’s.

<strong>It was the store my mother would take us to on an annual visit to the city sometime close to Christmas. </strong>We’d make a pilgrimage into town from Bucks County, driving to Olney and riding on the subway, a real novelty for my brother and I.

We’d see the store windows of Snellenbergs, Lits, Strawbridges and Gimbels department stores. We’d stuff nickels into the automat and retrieve a slice of lemon meringue pie from a little window of available pies. We’d meet my dad @ the eagle when he left work in town & visit the toy department and Santa @ Wanamakers, riding a little train around the ceiling of the 8 th floor before riding the subway and then driving home. This was an annual ritual.

<strong>How is this different?</strong>

The stores we visited are gone, Macy continues to operate Wanamakers building but there is no way that I was assembling indoors or meeting anyone. The Aqua classes resumed but were shut down. I never attempted to return. I knew @ some basic level that I would be crushed to resume and lose my freedom a gain. <strong>I’ve quarantined since 3/21/29

Would the black woman feel free to tap me on my shoulder this year after all the racial strife? I’m a 75 yo white-haired

White woman</strong>

The streets are full of unrest. <strong>When Congress finally hammered out a deal to provide some support for people Trump nixed it and played golf several times over the Christmas holiday.</strong>

<strong>Christmas Eve was a joyous time to be out and about in the city, meeting and interacting with strangers, in and out of crowds and stores, casualty using public transportation.</strong>

Most shopping was done online with packages delivered to your home. I don’t know if Macy’s will survive. Lord and Taylor is closing by year’s. end. Their store is on city avenue/@ the western suburban edge of the city.

Waiting for everyone to devour 
Consuming words they may or may not enjoy

Like those bag of chips in the vending machine
Bending my mind to give into to temptation’s
Craving as I stare at my translucent reflection 
To see through the looking plastic of food 
That’s quite terrible for my gut but great for my mind’s soul 
Solely spirited sauntering around from daydreams
To daymares of mistakes I am constantly trying to avoid
Mentally but this too shall pass somehow if I let my mind wander
And get lost in itself from fanfictions to dreams about achievements
I hope n know I can get to once I get down to business
To defeat my inner mind always adding extra weight when 
I just want to fly, but this weight I have will make me stronger
Slowly through sweat, sugar, and saltiness, 
I will overcome through it all and find the weight less heavy 
Helping heal hearts’ holes wholey 
Wonder why characters go through pain?
To remember the other versions of themselves 
To write new chapters and stories endlessly for the rest of time 
I wish this could rhyme more but it’s more about the journey 
That dash in between the numbers on a stone 
That last memory folks have of you before your face is forgotten 
That last photo people have of you wondering what type of person you were
That last second of an impact you had that made my day to never forget that 
A part of my soul is out there
With you.

She's 28 and working in Hawaii - too far to come home, quarantine, spend the holiday, and return</strong> to her own house and work life. Her father and I have been so cautious about distancing that we did not feel comfortable with her coming either. So,<strong> I made a stocking, filled it, packed boxes with gifts and spent time on the phone, face time and zoom with her daily. That has become usual for us</strong> during this time, because she is living solo in an apartment and in a new community.

<strong> I've been missing her a lot</strong> - but not nearly as much as when she left home for travels after last Christmas. In 2019, we spent nearly 6 weeks together - the longest stretch since she was in high school. I got used to her being part of our daily life. I've come to realize that missing my daughter is an ordinary part of life - not just during COVID times. But it seems a bit more pronounced these days because we don't have a ""choice"" to visit.

<strong> I better understand as a middle aged adult what my mother felt when I moved away</strong> from home many years ago.<strong> We grew up in Alaska and I was the only child to ""leave to the lower 48."" </strong> While we visited often, Mom knew we'd never live close again.<strong> That must have meant a special kind of loss for her</strong> - a quiet form of grieving the passing of our regular time together. Zoom, texting, and cell phones have made the distance much smaller. But I cannot be there for Mom or my daughter to help when they do not feel well.<strong> Mom got COVID-19 five weeks ago</strong> - and while we were all afraid she may get pneumonia, she fared okay at home. Her main symptoms post-COVID are dizziness, shortness of breath, and tiredness.<strong> We are grateful it wasn't worse. And, we hope that there are not invisible effects that will appear later.</strong>

<strong> This photo</strong> - to close -<strong> is of a patchwork stocking I made in the weeks before Christmas.</strong> Our daughter ""zoomed"" with us as she opened her gifts --<strong> 2020 Christmas was one of a handful I'll never forget.</strong> One passed in Northwest China when she was a toddler and we had a paper tree with paper ornaments on the wall. Another where my father was very sick from cancer and yet he rode the snow machine out to get the tree. And another when I did not go home and my father would pass days later. Among those years which stand out were many beautiful holidays spent either in Alaska or our home in the Lower 48 with family and friends.<strong> This year's was sad and sweet and beautiful.</strong>",2021-01-01 17:35:41,true,2021-01-05 05:29:11.964781,en,PJP_1035_1_EN_week31_journal_1_ptext.jpg
true,true,photo_and_text,Talk about what you think the world will be like after the pandemic is over.,"So <strong>on top of all the crazy COVID stuff, this week we are dealing with the aftermath of tropical storm Isaias</strong> with 700,000 customers without power in CT alone when it finally cleared out of here. Our electric company, Eversource, has been taken to task for underestimating the storm which is in the top three worst storms in recent times here in CT. I've been through the other two (Sandy and the freak October snowstorm in 2012) and yeah, its that bad. Trees and wires down everywhere.

<strong>I drove past this homemade sign the other day.</strong> A massive tree had fallen across the dead end road the sign is pointing down, wires pulled down everywhere, and even after 3 days there was still no crews in sight. Neighbors ended up cutting the tree themselves in order to be able just to get out to the main road. I talked to someone who lives on the road and they will be lucky if they get power back in a week, but it will probably take longer. When I drove past this sign ...I thought to myself, ""yeah, right good luck with that. Eversource will come when its good and ready, meanwhile you guys need to take matters into your own hands if you actually want to get through this.""

So <strong>what does all this have to do with the future after COVID? Increasingly I think we are being left to fend for ourselves across the board</strong> -- whether its after a major storm or in the face of a global pandemic. <strong>No government guidance, assistance, or protection so its going to to be up to us, individually and as families, to take care of ourselves.</strong> That seems to be the way Republican like it and they seem to have gotten their way in this country at least. When a crisis happens we pretty much have to take care of ourselves, our families and our friends, because no one is coming to assist us, at least not from any government body or in any official capacity.

","<strong>I'm usually an upbeat, happy person</strong> and feel lucky almost everyday to have a happy family, good friends, an interesting job, a nice house, a car that works, and to live where I do in the world. <strong>My optimism has certainly been tested since COVID began and like everyone else in the country, I've been experiencing a lot more downs than ups.</strong> I've tried to purposely spend time doing things that take my mind off all the crazy news and disordered state of our country and the world. One of these activities has been <strong>butterfly cocoon hatching.</strong>

I had visited Magic Wings Butterfly Sanctuary in Deerfield Mass back in February, before the virus arrived here, and found out they sell native butterfly and beneficial insect cocoons for you to hatch and release at home. I started ordering them online in April and have hatched almost 20 this summer -- different varieties of Swallowtails, Luna moths, and Polyphemus moths. <strong>The photo I've uploaded is of one of the Spicebush Swallowtails -- after her wings had unfolded and pumped up, she crawled onto my hand and sat there for about 5 minutes before flying away. </strong> I garden with native plants and flowers in order to attract and support wildlife, jokingly referring to it as my ""wildlife habitat"" rather than my garden, but I was thrilled when she flew directly across my yard and landed on the Spicebush I had planted which, as her name implies, is one of the plants on which they lay eggs. Its been incredibly joyful to come down some mornings to find that another has hatched and I will soon get to release them into my garden. Its one of my happy projects!

<strong>Of course not all of the cocoons are viable so that has been an important lesson too, that nature can be pretty cruel.</strong> About four of the moths and butterflies (out of the 20) seem unable to get out of their cocoons properly or their wings never fully open so they can't fly. I've read that for every viable cocoon there are several that aren't and will not hatch correctly -- Mother Nature's way of keeping down the butterfly and moth population I guess. I just wish she would apply the same logic to all the damn slugs who are munching on my garden plants every night! But <strong>my garden has been and remains one of my happy places</strong> and when it's not too hot I spend at least an hour or more after work each day in my garden -- watering, planting, weeding and deadheading.

I was putting our kiddush cups away in the china cabinet when one flew out of my hand and smashed into the salt water dish that I had inherited from my Bubbe.

But in the greater scheme of things, when everything is so scary and there's just a fine line between life and death, I'm not going to waste my time worrying about the fine lines in my now cracked salt water dish.

true,true,photo_and_text,What has changed most about the world since the pandemic began?,"Traveling and Keeping Fit During a Time of Social Distancing

The heightened consciousness the world has towards what we now call “social distancing” (people keeping physically 6+ feet away from each other) did not exist prior to the coronavirus pandemic but is a global concept that is here to stay. This awareness is especially true in relation to people’s willingness to be in large crowds among strangers. Travel and fitness have been two areas largely affected by this concept.

Prior to March 2020, the world bustled with domestic and international travel. We all had business meetings to conquer, people to see and places to experience. I had at least two trips already planned that I had been looking forward to taking. One trip was to Maine for my daughter’s college graduation and the other was to Seattle where my extended family planned to embark on a cruise to Alaska for my dad’s 80th birthday celebration. Both got cancelled, along with the collapse of the entire cruise industry. Likely, I would have taken additional trips in 2020 to places like Santa Fe (for my 26th wedding anniversary) and to Providence, RI where my son attends college.   

While inconvenient, I once thought nothing about spending considerable time waiting in crowded airports, standing in line at security or sitting at a busy bar close to my gate while sipping wine. Restrooms were always full of people from everywhere touching the same surfaces. Drinking fountains in airports were commonly used by everyone. As pictured, sitting shoulder-to-shoulder next to someone you did not know was an inevitable spacing reality on airplanes.

All of this was just part of air travel. I believe that most of us lived with a certain level of acceptance that a few additional germs would always be present while traveling. While we used hygiene measures like washing hands after visiting the restroom, US Americans did not worry much about contracting any diseases while flying. Most of the time, travel was for good reasons and involved having quite a bit of fun.

Now, many are hesitant to be in airports or to board airplanes at all where the same oxygen gets circulated repeatedly through a small, enclosed space. While I know people have flown and have remained safe, I am personally reluctant to fly again any time soon.

Running races and other multi sport events used to be something that I and so many others within fitness communities were busy doing. In-person races are now nonexistent. Participating might include flying to destinations. Races always involved standing in corals at the starting line with up to 50,000 other people. 

Most of us felt only excitement and anticipation as we waited for the start gun to go off. A lot of us had trained for months beforehand to see this day come true, so this was our time to shine. We had few thoughts about keeping physically distant from other runners, which was impossible to do anyway. Instead, we would sometimes chat with each other, laugh to control our nerves and take a few last-minute pictures within this joyful, crammed area.

“Body slide” with another person occasionally occurred while racing in hot, humid weather, especially during the first few miles of a longer distance. Your sweaty arm might slide across another person’s slippery skin while running in a crowd.

“Excuse me,” we would say to one other and continue running with no further thoughts about the encounter. No one had any concept of keeping 6 feet apart back then.

Crossing the finish line among crowds of cheering spectators was part of the “high” we got from races. Again, being packed together with other sweaty finishers at the bottleneck medal and swag collecting spots was just part of any race.   

Now, my runs begin at 4:30 am so I can avoid all other people and minimize physical spacing issues as much as possible. I have created new, zig zag running paths in the park in order to be able to swing wide of other runners and walkers that I do encounter. Keeping safe physical spacing while running has involved me having to jump low stone walls, run in ditches and stop entirely to wait for someone to finish crossing a narrow bridge.  

While new virtual races have cropped up during this peculiar time, all in-person large-scale races have been cancelled for 2020. That included the first marathon 26.2-mile race I had training for which was supposed to occur on May 17, 2020. Able to defer my entry to either May 2021 or May 2022, I remain unsure what to do. I simply do not know when racing will make sense again. 2021 may be too soon for me to feel safe being in a large crowd of people breathing hard and sweating on each other.   

Now, there are days during which I literally do not leave the house, let alone my city, state or country. Months later, I have not ventured more than one mile from home. Likely, many more will pass in the same manner. The few times where I have been out in public to a retail store, for example, I have worn a face mask to cover my nose and mouth. Everyone else was doing the same. Only one person from each party was allowed inside the store for safer physical spacing. That is certainly different from our pre-pandemic reality.

The gym of which I am a member reopened this past week. People are required to use an app on their own phone to avoid the touch check-ins we used to do at the front desk. Gym users are required to make reservations in advance for a limited time slot. I have not yet returned to the gym, a place I used to frequent 6-days a week. I am in no rush to be sharing the same enclosed space with strangers, something I never thought about before. The indoor pool part is still closed anyway.

true,true,photo_and_text,Talk about how the events of recent months have affected either your work or your ability to work.,"COVID-19 has HUGELY affected both my ability to work and the work that I was doing. In a nutshell, my industry, which had been booming, full swing, prior to March 2020, currently no longer exists due to the virus.

Pre-pandemic, I worked part-time as an Experiential Marketing Specialist, or Brand Ambassador (BA) in the promotions industry. This work required a person to be flexible about doing a multitude of tasks while onsite at a promotion. She must have a super positive demeanor, be friendly to everyone and above all, be comfortable working front and center within large crowds of strangers at all times, like at the Westward Music Festival (pictured here).

Although my personality skews towards introverted, I have been able to be a strong brand ambassador, regardless. This has been partly because I have been willing to wear so many different hats as BA while having fun in the process.

I have done everything from donning an official, Universal Studios minion costume on a float in downtown’s Parade of Lights, to giving hand massages to anyone at a busy festival, wearing a sandwich board while being bounced around in a drunken crowd during St. Patrick’s Day celebrations, taking iPad leads at huge concerts and football games and so much more. Promotional work is social, entertaining and has enabled me to interact with different kinds of people from many walks of life with which I would never otherwise have had contact. I have enjoyed the work and am grateful for which I get booked. ...
By early March 2020 when the highly contagious nature of COVID 19 became widely known (especially among large groups), my industry literally crumbled overnight. All work I did have in the pipeline literally disappeared into thin air. I was 100% job-free with absolutely no prospects of finding one drop of similar work to replace what I had lost. Unfortunately, I had tons of company. Everyone in my position suddenly found themselves completely out of work. ...
Admittedly, I have had a degree of ambivalence towards working in an industry that sometimes has made its non-benefited workers chase after their pay and that largely exists at all to enable corporations to make more money. Thus, I have been willing to give only so much of myself, my time and energy to promotions. Possessing a master’s degree, I also know that I have other options if this pandemic (or anything else) makes exiting necessary. I can feel only so passionate about what this pandemic so clearly and painfully highlights as easily disposable, “non-essential” work. Despite these comments, I will also say that I have enjoyed striving to be the best BA I can be during the last 6-years and hope to contribute further to events when the work within the industry safely returns.",2020-06-30 22:25:38,true,2020-07-06 21:15:53.148065,en,PJP_1056_1_EN_week5_journal_2_ptext.jpg
true,true,photo_and_text,Talk about what is most upsetting or scaring you right now about the coronavirus pandemic.,"I make a point of living a life that focuses on beauty that can be found in each day. I try not to actively worry about COVID on a daily basis at this point. 

I could lose sleep every night nursing my fears related to the outcome of the upcoming US presidential election, massive new virus outbreaks at schools and universities, inadequate hospital staff and medical supplies and more. I could be a bigger emotional wreck about how this fall and winter may turn out, if I let myself, but I do not. I cannot. I try to keep my fears about COVID focused on my own life versus expanding my anxiety out into a vast universe of infinite worry. 

Thus, I would say that my greatest fear regarding COVID centers around me or any family member contracting COVID and surviving, but then suffering long term, permanent debilitating effects, despite having almost no pre-existing health conditions.

Currently healthy as an ox (and challenged only with minor, exercise induced asthma), I do not believe that this virus would kill me or my immediate family. (My parents, close to 80-years old, may be a different story). I am less, sure about whether we would escape the pernicious health effects that so many appear to struggle with long after the active virus is gone. 

A notion exists that COVID manifests as an intense cold for non-senior healthy people and then disappears altogether “like the flu but just worse.” I have read too many stories written by real people that indicate otherwise. Involved in various online running and triathlete groups, I have read posts that previously strong athletes have made about their experiences with COVID that indicate that healthy people can suffer permanent internal damage.

“In 2019 I completed my third Ironman. Now, I struggle to catch my breath after going up one flight of stairs, still, 5 months later. I have since sold my tri-bike because I think my racing days are over,” someone said.

A different person in her early 30s said that she and her family are still dealing with neurological issues 19 weeks after getting her first COVID symptoms.

NPR reported a story uncovering the existence of ”long-haulers""—younger, previously healthy people who are sick for months with a low level of COVID 19. They may experience effects like bouts of fatigue, memory issues (and more) that existing COVID tests do not detect. In addition to dealing with debilitating conditions, long-haulers report experiencing difficulty getting proper, COVID-related healthcare. Because their symptoms extend beyond those commonly associated with the virus, healthcare providers do not always even believe these patients have COVID.

I do not want this to be ME!

I place a PREMIUM on being in top-notch health and have made every proactive attempt at keeping myself strong and fit, seven-days a week. Being fit is an essential part of my identity and lifestyle. I aim for lifetime participation in activities like running, swimming, lifting and yoga. These things are vital in keeping me mentally and emotionally healthy and happy as a productive member of society.

I fear that COVID could possibly impair the quality of my life permanently, leaving me less active and more prone to anxiety and depression for many years to come. Hopefully, my fears will remain in my head and will have no basis in reality.

<strong> La Semana Santa es un tiempo en que las personas salen de sus casas y conforman una comunidad </strong>, por ejemplo, al elaborar alfombras de aserrín para las imágenes que pasan en procesión. Es un tiempo en el que colaboran niños, jóvenes y adultos. Algunos hacen las alfombras, otros proveen comida gratuita a los que trabajan. Los mayores les enseñan a los niños como hacerlo. Se trabaja hombro con hombro. Es algo que difícilmente se puede ver en otras circunstancias. Se trabaja durante horas, de madrugada, hasta ver el amanecer. Y el resultado es una obra de arte, bella, que desaparecerá en segundos bajo el peso de las andas.

Las imágenes que salen en procesión representan actos de fe y devoción en quienes las cargan. Las devociones se trasladan de generaciones en generaciones en una misma familia. Las personas compran flores y las echan en las andas, se emocionan al verlas pasar. Es tan fuerte la vivencia, que es necesario experimentarla para comprenderla. Una señora amiga nuestra que murió hace unos años, durante su agonía, decía: ""Ya viene el cortejo, ya va a salir la procesión"". Así de fuerte se interioriza.

<strong> La Semana Santa es un imaginario lleno de tradiciones, leyendas, gastronomía, arte, música, y por supuesto, religiosidad.</strong>

Growing up Jewish she never connected with Christmas, but Thanksgiving was a holiday everyone celebrated</strong> in her mixed income, predominantly white mid western neighborhood in the 1950s, so it helped her feel totally connected with everyone else in her school and in her community. She’s been known to go a little crazy when it comes to celebrating. She has tons of ceramic pumpkins – plus a really beautiful Le Creuset pumpkin tureen we got her one year — and has been known to collect and iron multicolored leaves in advance to decorate the table. She also has a white blouse embroidered with Thanksgiving leaved and cornucopias and Pilgrims and who knows what that she always breaks out for the once a year occasion. We tease her for it, but of course we love it.

<strong> I’ve always loved Thanksgiving too,</strong> both because it was definitely our holiday (again, unlike Christmas), and in part because growing up it always started with lots of cooking on Wednesday, then stretched into a lazy Friday and the full weekend. In college it was even better because the beginning of Thanksgiving week would feel so quick, and the anticipation would be so great. The Macy’s Thanksgiving day parade has always been a beloved tradition in our family too, ever since my sibs and I would watch it in footie pajamas on the fold out couch in the family room when we were small.

Of course we knew this year would be really different. We knew we wouldn’t have the whole family, from grandparents to young cousins and everyone in between, all piled up in a single house sharing rooms and beds, having cousin sleepovers, leaving kids with my parents to watch so we could go out on rare dinner dates and eat fancy food and drink fancy drinks with no kids around.<strong> When we saw these thankful signs</strong> at Michael’s — strings of simple balsa wood letters on a hemp rope — <strong> we bought one for my mom and another for us, then went back and bought more</strong> for the rest of the family.

<strong> Usually Chanukah is all about get togethers</strong> with friends at our house or their houses. Big annual parties, community celebrations. Shipment of presents — two kids x eight days each — that my mom brings along when they visit for Thanksgiving and leaves with us, squirreled away in a closet, until the appropriate moment.

Someone close to me registered about a year ago for a seat at an on-campus event by a right-wing group -- K-Pop style, to keep the seat empty -- and, since he apparently is still on their mailing list, got an email about buses planned to take local people to DC for the rally -- from here, all the way up the East Coast.Long story short:<strong> there was nothing at all surprising about the convergence of radical maniacs and Trumpists in DC to make a scene. Nothing at all.</strong> How many agencies should have organized to plan, coordinate, defend -- the building, the entrances, the country's elected officials? Seriously?

We were both working at our desks when I got a text to ""Famiglia"" (our family group chat) from Mom asking if we knew what was going on. We tried to listen / read / watch and work for a while. But as more of the mob entered the Capitol and more images and livestreaming popped up on Twitter, CNN, NBC (we eventually turned on the TV, which we NEVER do -- certainly not in the middle of the day), I started viscerally feeling the anxiety and tension in my body. WTF was happening? More messages on WhatsApp and in a group work chat from friends and colleagues overseas.

<strong> It's been about 36 hours now, and I feel like I still haven't even really begun to process what happened, or what the entire world could see in real time,</strong> and then in video clips and photos: MAGA maniacs strolling right into the Capitol, some of them wearing crazy things. The youngish guy with the horns and the red/white/blue painted face. The older guy with the black sweatshirt that said ""Camp Auschwitz""(!!!) casually talking on his cellphone, the cord apparently plugged into a reserve battery in a front pocket. Scaling the outer wall of the Capitol. On a window-washing apparatus getting ready to break in. Crashing windows and breaking in. Tussling with police inside the building. Using a barricade with a T@#$ flag on it as a battering ram trying to break through tall wooden doors -- into one of the chambers? Congressmembers and staffers ducking to hide in the gallery, barricading themselves in offices -- all with masks on, of course, and reporting they'd been told to use the gas masks under their seats because of tear gas. Yes, tear gas in the rotunda of the US capitol.

<strong> The photo here -- taken by a pro-T$#% journalist, who quickly deleted it because, well, maybe he was tweeting about committing a crime? -- showing an unsecure computer in Nancy Pelosi's office.</strong> The guy sitting in an office chair -- Nancy Pelosi's seat? -- with his feet on the desk. Video of the Senate parliamentarian's office ransacked, papers strewn everywhere, lamps askew. People on the Senate floor rifling through desks -- stealing things? planting things? Who even knows.

<strong> How they managed to secure the building again in time for the proceedings to continue is beyond me.</strong> When we stopped watching -- to try to work a bit, to get the kids -- it was probably a solid 2-2 1/2 hrs after the siege began (was that a siege? I'm looking up words because I don't even know how to describe all this), and we saw on NBC a stream of police cars, sirens going, heading toward Capitol Hill. Before then, for HOURS, apparently, these people had been milling around, destroying things, probably stealing things, terrifying people. It's only now, tonight, that I'm seeing some of the photos and footage from what happened after the National Guard arrived with riot gear.

<strong> Jelani Cobb had a solid tweet today</strong> (yes, I probably am spending too much time on Twitter these days):<strong> ""After making two documentaries about police brutality I never thought I would be this disgusted by a show of police restraint.""</strong>

<strong> This is all just skimming the surface of what yesterday was like.</strong> Somewhere in there, Ossoff was declared victor in the second Georgia Senate race. In the evening, kiddo #2 and I worked assiduously on a 200 piece train puzzle while I tried to listen to the radio broadcast of the<strong> speeches on the Senate floor</strong> once they were back in session. (How did they clean up the building in time? How did they know it was secure-- that no one was hiding, that no explosive devices were planted, that secure documents hadn't been stolen from Congressional offices?) Heard Mitch McConnell try to weasel his way out of blame. Watched Kelly Loeffler give a flat-toned speech about how after all that had happened, she was withdrawing her objection to recognizing the electoral college results. Watched clips from DC hotels where people who may well have been in the Capitol violating federal law just hours earlier are sitting around drinking beer, chatting, eating, hanging out calm and maskless with their MAGA hats and rolled up banners.

<strong> And today: calls to invoke the 25th Amendment from some quarters, for impeachment from others.</strong> And then those NYT and WaPo lists of ALL the Republicans who voted for objections to confirming the electoral college results. And this afternoon and evening, all the cowards resigning to avoid having to vote on a 25th Amendment question -- Elaine Chao, Betsy DeVos, Mick Mulvaney, etc. Spineless, every one of them.

 On one hand it's all so wild, feels so unreal. And yet for anyone who's been paying attention these past 4-odd years, it's no surprise. <strong> None of this is a surprise. Not the sedition,</strong> not the<strong> white supremacy,</strong> not the<strong> violence,</strong> not the<strong> complicity on the part of Republicans in office,</strong> not the fucking<strong> selfie taken by mob people with Capitol Police</strong>. As someone said on tv today, maybe Joy Reid (?), it's shocking, but it's no surprise.

<strong> Oh yeah, and there's this pandemic going on.</strong> How many cases of Covid did these traitors cause yesterday? The US broke a new record today:<strong> more than 4,000 people died of COVID. Today.</strong>

true,true,photo_and_text,"How is the coronavirus pandemic affecting your life right now? Tell us about your experiences, feelings, and thoughts.","We're now deep into our<strong> second Passover during the pandemic.</strong> Zooming felt less weird, of course, and it was less painful to be gathering this way than in person as we'd hoped and expected last year.

There are moments, like the first seder, when it really hits how long we've been in this.<strong> A year ago, at last year's Zoom seder, my brother and sister-in-law held up an ultrasound picture and announced that they were expecting their second child. At this year's seder, he was there, a sweet infant</strong> ...

The rest of the kids (the other 4) are bigger now. Their older one, a toddler, was ready to sing along with songs she learned in her preschool. The oldest three -- ages 8, 7, and 5 -- were all able to read, sing the four questions, brainstorm ways to make the world a better place, drawing inspiration from Elijah the prophet. My uncle joined, as did my in-laws from Europe despite the time difference and late hour.

<strong> With everyone so far apart, it felt especially important to fill the table with the ritual objects that have been part of our family life,</strong> even if we were the only ones using them up close:<strong> Grandma's seder plate. My great grandma's silver candlesticks</strong> -- which I suddenly realized I'm incredibly lucky to have since she had about over a dozen great-grandchildren. The<strong> egg-shaped horseradish dish my great-aunt gave me</strong> years ago, some time after she'd taught me and the now ex-husband of my cousin how to make her famous gefilte fish from scratch.<strong> A delicate painted wine glass given to us as an engagement present by a wonderful mentor and his wife</strong>, which we now use for Miriam's water cup. It was part of a pair, but we broke the other one years ago -- and now have given this one a new life on our seder table. (I even love the bud vase we used this year for the daffodils our big kid accidentally cut too short. It's a Campari bottle I snagged decades ago on an airplane, back when alcohol flowed freely on international flights and no one checked ID.)<strong> These are all just objects, just stuff, but they're so much a part of what makes the holiday feel right -- or at least right-ish, which is about where we're at right now.</strong>",2021-03-29 04:51:09,true,2021-03-29 19:27:46.470656,en,PJP_1068_1_EN_week42_journal_1_ptext.jpeg
true,true,photo_and_text,Additional Material,"<strong> Years ago, at an annual rummage sale, I bought this silver tea set for about $40.</strong> This is the kind of rummage sale where you can tell people are clearing out the homes of their parents who are aging/relocated to retirement homes/deceased. It's a terrific window onto changing tastes and how younger generations have little patience for the trousseau-style materiality of post-war weddings and associated bourgeois accumulation. My grandmother had a tea set like this (probably both), my mom has a tray like this, and probably lots of middle class women who got married in the 1940s, 50s, maybe even 60s and 70s in the US had this kind of stuff -- which<strong> probably now strikes many as unbelievably kitschy</strong>. As for me,<strong> I love it.</strong>

I initially saw the set in the huge rummage sale hall and didn't buy it immediately, but then I sat at my desk thinking about it all morning and eventually hopped in the car and went back saying ""if it's still there, I'm buying it and that's it."" Well it was still there, and now it's mine.

When I got it, I used it a few times -- most memorably, for our daughter's 3rd birthday party, where we had ""pink"" (hibiscus) and peach tea for a couple of little ones who wore pink hats and decorated mugs at the picnic table in our backyard -- but since then it's mostly sat in our basement getting increasingly tarnished and gathering dust.

<strong> This weekend, with the first glimmers of spring arriving, I decided it was time for a tea party. Spent a good hour and change polishing the whole thing, tried a new lemon cake recipe, and had a friend from the neighborhood and her daughters over to hang out with us</strong> for tea at the picnic table. The kids all see each other at school every day, but I hadn't seen my friend in a couple of months -- after lots of summer and fall masked gatherings outdoors to drink wine around fire pits and such.

They both lived in Harlem prior to the pandemic and moved out over the summer. They were trying to move to Brooklyn and wanted me to join them, so here I am.

<strong>My dad died last Wednesday. He was buried on Sunday.</strong> And because of the Time-of-Corona, we have completed our public mourning rituals a few days early. <strong>Dad is now by Mom’s side—and they are under a bench that reads, “It was a great run.” Yes, it was.</strong>

<strong>We, the kids, ages 59 to 67, dodged some huge potential bullets.</strong> Dad lived in senior housing that did not have any cases of Covid. Phew! While Dad missed us, missed seeing us on a regular basis, missed the ability to go to play bridge or kibbitz in the dining room, missed visits with his lady friend, he did experience Zoom, while staying comfortably indoors. <strong>He was thrilled to watch his grandson get married — with only an hour’s notice.</strong> Dad was delighted to zattend (zoom + attend) the wedding, and was happy with the ability to watch the ceremony in his bathrobe.

<strong>I am thankful for what Dad did not experience.</strong> He didn’t suffer with a debilitating illness, a recurrence of the throat cancer he had 18 years ago. He never faced years, months, or even weeks of disease. We learned that his esophagus stopped functioning. He couldn’t swallow anymore. It hurt to eat. He definitely did not want a feeding tube. And he never told us any of these things. He told one of his fellow residents that he was going. He wouldn’t see a doc and he didn’t complain.

What did happen was that he woke up in poor health last Tuesday. We, the kids, rallied and coordinated implementing hospice and 24/7 care—which was in place by 7pm. <strong>My sibs and I all were able to visit Dad—a miracle in the Time of Corona.</strong> We talked with Dad, held his hands, looked into his eyes. He looked back. We were able to say goodbye.

Last Tuesday, before midnight, Dad received his first dose of a morphine/Ativan mix. He died about 24 hours later. He lived 93 years, 8 months of a great life, and he experienced a relatively short exit. That, according to a friend’s campfire story late one night, was a blessing. Yes, we lost our dad. What we didn’t lose was months of agony, fear, anguish, self-doubt, exhaustion. My heart breaks for friends and acquaintances whose parents lose consciousness, or brain function, or dignity. <strong>The heartbreak of Covid is the distance of family members. There are stories of family members who cannot see or touch their parents.</strong> They stand outside, both psychological and geographical states away.

He is now buried under a bench that is designed for visits. </strong>Even in death, Dad can entertain, surrounded by family and friends. <strong>He had a great run.</strong>",2020-08-19 09:34:20,true,2020-08-24 05:28:13.960601,en,PJP_1113_1_EN_week10_journal_1_ptext.jpeg
true,true,photo_and_text,"Are you doing anything artistic or creative these days that you weren’t doing before? If so, talk about it.","<strong>Definitely the ukulele is one of the joys of this pandemic.</strong>

I had started to play a few years ago, but then got caught up in life’s persistent activities, and stopped for a while. In January, I joined a weekly community ed class. By March, I was one of the regulars when the class was forced to meet on Zoom. Our teacher hosted a weekly meetup through which I learned about other jam sessions and additional instructors. By a month into quarantine, I was taking three to four classes a week, which led to additional drop-in sessions. I started listening to daily ukulele tips stretched from 5 minutes to nearly an hour, depending upon the presenter. In other words, yes, I am doing something artistic that I wasn’t doing before, and honestly, I think the ukulele is keeping me sane in the chaos of lockdown.

Ukulele is a happy folk instrument played by casual and serious musicians. Many of us had not played a musical instrument before, or not seriously pursued musical experiences. It’s tremendously creative and forgiving. Easier than guitar, the uke has only four strings—and I have four fingers—so a relative beginner can make some nice sounds. Our groups are collaborative. Everyone offers positive suggestions. It’s just plain fun. I’m even arranging some of the songs, writing melody, counter-melody and combining the two.

Even though I have not met any of them in person, my weekly fingerpicking group is my go-to feel good group. We’ve bonded over music and life stages. We truly care for one another. I hope that someday when we are able to once again gather in public, we will actually meet. Because of zoom, our regular groups consist of people from all over the globe.

In lockdown, Australia can be next door. I enjoy an occasional class given by the guy in Albuquerque. One teacher is in England and one of my study partners this week is in Italy. I have new friends in Texas and California...and I’m outside of Boston. That’s the cool thing about Zoom sessions that wouldn’t be possible —nor have even crossed my mind — before Covid.

<strong>Before Covid I didn’t take it that seriously. During quarantine, ukulele is my lifeline. </strong>I find I can lose myself in the music, and in the camaraderie.

If so, give some examples of what feels different.","<strong>This time of year feels completely different</strong> from years past. We are <strong>celebrating the Jewish New Year without friends and family.</strong> These are contemplative holidays for individuals, which are habitually celebrated together, in a room with more than 300 others. So <strong>while we reflect on our lives and how we can make the world a better place, we are used to being with at least some of the rest of the world.</strong> This year, as we start the fast for Yom Kippur, the day of both atone-ment and at-ONE-meant, we are not with others. We will have a simple meal at home, and then turn on a computer for Zoom. It won’t be the same.

<strong>In years past, it has been a balancing act</strong> of serving enough food before the 25 hour fast, followed by a frantic drive to services. Yom Kippur is the most popular service of the year. Parking was always complicated! We would rush into the building to get good seats, hugging friends along the way. <strong>This year, there will be no driving. No rush hour traffic, and sadly, no hugs.</strong>

It feels stingy to shop for such a small amount of food for such important holidays. Setting the table for only two seems too little. Cooking for two feels selfish. I’m used to preparing holiday meals for everyone.

On top of the alone-ness of this usually social moment, this is the first year that we do not have my dad, who died just 6 weeks ago, with us. In fact, this the first year in our 47 years together that we do not have any parents.

<strong>I found this sign in the woods. It’s the corrugated version of a flag I had ordered.</strong> So for a while we had both the lawn sign version and the banner version outside of our home. <strong>I should order a t-shirt version, too, because this small rectangle holds the basis for what I believe.</strong> I will not willingly interact with, or do business with, anyone who doesn’t believe—and vote—this way. Our country is so divided, and I’m feeling it.

The Coronavirus is the hallmark of the dividing line. <strong>Mask it or casket. No one should have the right to willingly endanger other citizens, and I’m afraid that the leadership of this country has abdicated its position in the most dangerous possible way</strong>—all because the White House resident does not believe that lives of others matter. He — and his VP in last night’s debate — demonstrate an inability to listen to women. Their actions define those who do not have their income levels as illegal. They certainly are not listening to science. Love and kindness are not even part of their vocabularies. And it is causing me heartache, and probably affecting my blood pressure.

<strong>I cannot believe we have come to this as a nation.</strong> Our Constitution does not seem to mean anything. <strong>I want to call someone, but there is no adult who is in charge at this time</strong>. My heart breaks for the career workers at the White House, who are not only exposed to this deadly virus, but are now bringing it home to their families. The utter selfish power grab of the GOP could kill us all. The covidiot-in-chief will stop at nothing.

And so <strong>I helped get several hundred Reclaim the Vote postcards into the mail. I have made a countless number of masks. I have made political contributions. </strong>For every small thing that we have done from this household, this administration and its minyans put up more barriers to democracy. The governor of Texas has ordered just one ballot dropbox per county, meaning that more than one million people will have just one place to bring their early ballots. It isn’t fair, and it shouldn’t be legal. The lives of Americans, and the life of America depend on a Supreme Court that is no longer fair, nor balanced. There will be desperate people. There will be deaths. And <strong>I cannot do enough on my own.</strong>

I don’t know whether I need to psychologically drop out of the news cycle, or jump in with two feet. Either way <strong>I am overwhelmed with a citizen’s smallness in the face of reality. </strong>I used to feel pride in my participation in the political process. <strong>As a woman facing open misogyny, a Jew in a time of rising anti-semitism, a compassionate person concerned with all human rights, I will vote for the policies that defined this country—and fear that the unity of these United States has been corrupted for generations.</strong>",2020-10-08 11:33:03,true,2020-10-08 13:31:24.358673,en,PJP_1113_1_EN_week16_journal_1_ptext.jpeg

I submitted this photograph for the Newton Community Pride photography competition. ... This is what I wrote for my contest submission:

""From the beginning of the Covid lock-down, I sewed more than 350 masks—asking only that recipients donate to the Newton Food Pantries. After completing each batch, I would tape labeled packages to our front door. When friends, neighbors, and others, came to pick up their masks, I would open the door a few inches, just enough to hear one another. I cherish those visits, as mask-making seemed like my only personal contact to the outside world. This photo was taken in early spring, less than one month into lock-down.""

We had spent a few weeks there in 2019, as well.<strong> We were beginning to read articles about a worldwide contagion, but no one knew what that really meant. No masks, no worries, just anticipation for another interesting trip.</strong> We flew out on a Friday, I recall, so that we could join up with others from the business side of our travels, to explore Sintra (pictured), a park area outside of Lisbon proper that is filled with castles and beautiful wooded areas. Beside the business that my husband did with this group, I had traveled with them for more than 10 years, and so we were looking forward to cameraderie during the first part of our travels, and then a fascinating getaway to what had once been a center of Jewish life, and tragically, after 1492, became the center of the Inquisition.

One year ago we were packing for a trip. One year ago we were counting on business, history, romance, identity, incredibly delicious food, adventure and just plain fun.<strong> One year later, we aren’t packing, that’s for sure.</strong> Not only haven’t we traveled in 272 days, we haven’t even left the house for a few, because it is really, really cold outside (5 degrees Fahrenheit this morning). My husband is recovering from surgery, and hasn’t been “out and about” for almost two weeks. So here we are: no passports, no travel, no room service, not seeing friends, no wandering about, no adventures, just home.

Not that I’ve ever been on lockdown before,<strong> it hasn’t been horrible.</strong> We are incredibly lucky.<strong> We have a market across the street, we have a roof over our heads, and a lovely home</strong> where we used to house constant visitors.

While this version is fun, it is a poor substitute for the real thing, a real getaway with laughter and learning, and a sense of accomplishment. No hot tub time, no dashing into a fabric store for a bit of this or that. No chocolate! No gift swap. There is, however, a sense of accomplishment as I check projects off of my ToDo list.

Just a few more months, and I might actually clean up my colorful project room.

<strong> And yet, I still made charoses for a crowd.</strong> Charoses (or, the Sephardic pronunciation, “charoset”) is<strong> the apple-walnut-wine concoction which resembles the mortar of the bricks our forefathers had to use to build the pyramids in Egypt.</strong> The story is that the Jews were slaves in Egypt. Because we worked so hard to be free, we should live and work for the liberation of all people.

My charoses is made with apples, walnuts, sweet kosher wine, cinnamon sugar, and nutmeg (my secret ingredient). I forgot to add honey this year. It was still terrifically delicious. It is always a patchke (pahtch-key) to make this Passover treat. The food processor and the counter around it end up covered in sticky apple juice drippings, requiring hot soapy water to fully clean the prep space. First I chop the walnuts and add them to the mixing bowl. Then I add apple to the spinning processor, about 2-3 apples at a time. Then, all of the cinnamon sugar in the house, plus a bit more, plus plenty of sweet kosher wine. Cover the bowl and shake it up, and let it sit in the fridge for a day before the seder meal.

I’ll make some more today.

There’s an occasional streetcar sound—much fewer lately, because who really wants to get on public transportation in the middle of a pandemic. Few cars—many of us are still working from home, or simply staying put, because that is what is called for these days, four months into quarantine, going on five.

Our gardens this year flourish with cucumber leaves measuring 10” across and down.

For a dozen years I had lived and breathed that organization—running it from my home office, and doing everything from fundraising to outreach to inspiring volunteers, which I called “volunticipants.” I was just about to relax into “whatever comes next,” when we discovered that “nothing” was going to be the thing that comes next.

<strong> We connected through Zoom. I learned that I require people—whether through Zoom or the good old fashioned way</strong>. I thrive on connections to others—even if those people are only two inches tall. In my case—and that’s what a journal is all about—<strong> I had started to play the ukulele and found daily lessons and online jam sessions. It meant that I was meeting people from all over the world</strong> who had a common purpose: to play a song. Some of us were beginners, like me. Some were professionals. On Zoom it doesn’t really matter, because only the leader can be heard, while all the rest of us are muted. I was learning something, and joining in. I centered my day around musical moments—a totally novel way of spending time. Players from those groups are some of my best friends now, even though many of us have never met in person. If it ever becomes safe to travel again, I look forward to traveling to the cities of those other players to meet them in person.

<strong> I learned that I need to feel like I’m part of the solution. At the beginning of lockdown I made 375 masks—or mask kits for others to assemble—because I could.</strong> Quilters have fabric. In the beginning, the only thing any of us knew was that masks might save us from this deadly dreaded virus.<strong> It gave me a purpose and an opportunity.</strong> I would stitch away in my home sewing room, and leave labeled bags taped to my front door for anyone who needed them<strong>. I exchanged those masks for donations to our local food pantries. Solutions.</strong>

<strong> I learned to schedule things in, because before you know it, the day will be over.</strong> That’s especially true in the winter, when the sun rises late and then sets so soon. That’s true in the spring, summer, and fall, too.

<strong> I learned to reach out to others</strong>. Always a relatively social person, I’ve reached out to friends because casual interactions just cannot happen when we are purposely homebound. We set up our front porch with two seating areas, so that we could still see friends, even if only outdoors. We invested in a fire pit, for the same reason.

Zoom cocktails, Zoom tea, Zoom music, Zoom chats—they’re all better than just a phone call. Social connections count.

Beyond old friends, I am trying to reach out to new people—especially single people who are living alone, some of whom have illnesses that make them particularly susceptible to the ravages of Covid. Drop off care packages. Find time. Make a difference in someone’s life.

<strong> And, it’s that time of year, the end of December, when we think about our various financial donations to non-profit organizations</strong>. We’re upping our numbers this year because fortunately we can, and because they need it.<strong> Food related, housing related, caring-related charities get my attention, because that comes first. Anyone who’s hungry cannot focus on anything else until they have food in their belly. Everyone deserves a roof over their heads</strong>. In this world of such wealth, it is unconscionable that so many are so invisibly ignored.

<strong> I’ve always known these things. Lockdown, and the Pandemic Journaling Project, as well as other journaling, has given me the opportunity to focus on these realities.</strong>",2021-12-13 12:29:31,true,2021-12-25 05:38:34.942675,en,PJP_1113_1_EN_week77_journal_2_ptext.jpeg

<strong> For the record, for all you future historians studying this archive when those of writing this are all dead (Hopefully of old age and not covid) let's be clear:</strong>

<strong> IT DIDN""T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY.</strong> New record deaths--Three thousand just today. And we've still got months and months to go. No national mask mandate. No national movement restrictions. Hospitals rationing medicine. People getting sent home to die.

true,true,photo_and_text,"How is the coronavirus pandemic affecting your life right now? Tell us about your experiences, feelings, and thoughts.","<strong> When we all realized we had to wear masks, I developed an elaborate system of ordering my masks</strong> in a row and always taking from the right side, so that I could be sure that any mask I had been using had had at least five days to ""dry"" out and for any virus on it to shed.

<strong> Now I'm down to a coat rack, masks thrown about, no order whatsoever. This is how I feel these days--completely scattered and without any sense of forward direction.</strong>

It's true,<strong> we are coming out of winter, the vaccines are here, but the messiness of the vaccines is so depressing.</strong> My very progressive county, in an effort to be equitable, is holding back tons of vaccine until poor people and people of color can get them. Meanwhile tons of old people and teachers can't get them through the county and have to look elsewhere.

At the same time, the governor (a republican) is sending a ton of vaccines to the pharmacies because they are less stringent about who they vaccinate. I find myself in the off position of actually supporting a Republican in this case.<strong> I have lost patience with people who are skeptical about the vaccines.</strong> If you don't want them, then just get out of the way and let other people have them. I feel like that is totally classist and racist of me, but I have friends over 65 who are going crazy trying to get vaccines. In this case, there really is scarcity. The rollout has been such a huge mess it's depressing.

And<strong> meanwhile, my mother, like SO many other elderly people in care homes, is deteriorating emotionally from 12 fricking months of isolation and there's nothing my brothers and I can do about it.</strong> Part of me feels guilty for complaining because, hey--she's alive, she has food, she has medical care, at least she didn't die alone in an ICU, suffocating in her own lungs

But then I think, oh Fuck that. I'm just angry and sad that this whole pandemic happened, that Chinese bureaucrats fucked this up, and Trump fucked it up, and the world fucked it up and it's still here and how many people have suffered and died.

<strong> I've been trying to keep it together</strong> for my family and stay cheerful,  but I don't know.<strong> I think I ran out of happy steam or happy juice or whatever it was motivating me to be up.</strong> I just want me and everyone else to be vaccinated and all the bickering everywhere to stop.",2021-02-24 20:38:25,true,2021-02-27 06:46:33.787192,en,PJP_1117_1_EN_week36_journal_1_ptext.jpg

Last minute, i said to my husband, ""Why don't we ride our bikes to DC?""</strong> (We live in Maryland, just over the district line). So we loaded up with water and food and my phone with a map, and rode our bikes all the way downtown on bike paths! No cars anywhere. We rode the (Somewhat) new Anacostia River Walk trail--8 miles through Southeast DC and it was lovely.<strong> 18 miles in total for the ride. It was so great to be outside and seeing sights!.

Everyone was in a good mood.<strong> We stopped at a small park in DC on Capitol Hill to rest and there were lots of small groups of people congregating in the park, mostly unmasked too</strong>.

<strong> Then we rode our bikes to Union station to get the Metro home--here's the photo. Everything closed! I couldn't believe it. Usually Union Station is hopping at 3PM on a Saturday.</strong> But all the restaurants and stores were closed, even the lights were off. A lot of the shops looked like they'd gone out of business too. I guess some parts of DC haven't opened yet!

Además, he estado sufriendo la profunda necesidad, los ""cravings"", por las drogas que solía consumir. <strong> Es una sensación insoportable por momentos: un ardor interno que te quema la sangre y te hace perder los estribos. </strong> Como si todo eso no fuera ya un cóctel explosivo, <strong> debo agregarle el estar distanciada de mi pareja y un nuevo problema de salud. </strong>

Suddenly is a burden
Days ago came the call
“Tested positive,” I heard.
A wail sounds off in my mind
I cannot catch my breath
Nothing else is of value
More than the next days
More than family health
More than ridding virus
Passing by,family unscathed

There is no assurance
My son and grandson
Both have the covid virus

DJT has been deemed
A threat to democracy
Having incited insurrection
This moment the vote 
The 45th impeached.
My heart beats rapidly
As my mind spins facts
“Fear” by Woodward described
Knowing he hid the truth
How deadly the virus
He hid ifacts, so did party
Now ten republicans
Add votes to impeach.

There is no assurance
My grandson is four
A fever hit him yesterday.

I made the print in 2001
After 9/11 caused us pain
My face was torn in two
With globes spinning by
I added simple spikes
 A simple mask in ink 
But now concentric
Circles radiate outward
Encapsulating more
And more in rainbow
Hues as  400,000 
Perished, more follow 
Without Trump’s treatment
Given to Guliani too

There is no assurance
We wait at social distance
My heart ripped in two.

No one rampaging taking place in the Capitol
Today in Congress the president is again impeached.

Moderna shots received with my husband

At the new track facility in my hometown

Built, never used as lockdown began

First use? CERT volunteers open doors

Vaccines from orthopedic surgeons!

My second shot given by a young physician.

The educational park holds multiple schools

Next to this new track facility, now open

When I was in a sixth grader only

One school on the hillside as cows grazed .

I pondered what my grade school self might

Wonder seeing this future, 57 years onward.

How shocking ? Two shots saved our lives

With a year old pandemic sweeping by

Catching over three million souls

In a wake that also bred mistrust

Honoring the flag ? Are you right, left?

Ruby shot Oswald but Floyd dead on our screens

Fifty plus years ago displayed fallout shelter

Placed in our town square - what a sight

It might all end in a second, no notice

Try hiding young heads under school desks?

Now years later masks are new shelters

Injected vaccines saving lives cascading past.

The educational park holds old memories:

A line drive to my eye while pitching

A softball to a friend, knocking me out

I learned that epsom salts work well

I see girls in skirts galloping across fields

If not jumping ropes we warred in dodgeball

My half-foot shorter eleven year old self

Could not see her future husband running

An outdoor track to complete a virtual 5k

We had run so many BAA marathons

Patriots Day ‘21 we donned running gear

As golden hued forsythia lit the hillsides.

The pandemic issued in unique moments

So our 5k, of multiple track loops beckoned

Us on that Patriots Day weekend fully

Bright sun blinded us,dark clouds arose

As first light sprinkles of refreshing rain

Turned to hail stones as we ran for our jeep

Educational park was named for a neighbor

Voted “First selectman” he selected this land

The cows moved on, buildings now bearing

Names of farmers who worked the hillsides

And one field bears a classmate’s name

Who was a town coach, his name also honored.

We also walked loops circumventing the park

Daily with springer alert to resident ground hogs

The pandemic has made our routines range local

Discarded light blue masks, newly strewn refuse

So many seasons passed yet i see my younger self

Because of this, I spent time considering how I am going to be celebrate Halloween. <strong> Despite the restrictions we are forced to put up with, I still wanted to celebrate in my own special way.</strong> Just yesterday, I received a package from my parents. I had told them two weeks prior that I wanted some snacks that I would actually eat before I have to empty out my room. The box was filled with some of my favorite candy and other goodies. I was very excited. It motivated me to think of further plans for Halloweekend. I spent some time today playing a <strong>virtual game of ""Clue"" </strong>... It was a really fun time for all of us; we enjoyed ourselves very much. <strong> I plan to spend the next day eating some candy and watching a Halloween themed movie,</strong> after I finish some work. I also bought a ticket to watch a movie for the 29th annual<strong> Philadelphia Film Festival</strong> since one of my friends is their ambassador this year. I will be watching that this coming Sunday.<strong> Celebrating Halloween during the pandemic has given me time to think about other events.</strong> Although this crisis has been tough for all of us, we must make the most of the good times. When life gives you lemons, you always have to find a way to make lemonade.<strong> For me, coming up with revised ways to celebrate Halloweekend has been a good way to work around the effects of this pandemic.</strong> It may not be the most ideal celebration, but it works in a time like this. Now that we only have three weeks left of classes, I am more grateful every day for how far we have come.",2020-10-31 01:05:40,true,2020-10-31 19:32:44.168055,en,PJP_1369_1_EN_week8_journal_1_ptext.jpg

The way that the school district has decided to reopen is classes in the morning online, followed by class either online or in person, depending which option you opted in to. There are two in-person cohorts (one goes into school on Mondays and Tuesdays, and the other on Thursdays and Fridays) and one virtual cohort. There is no school on Wednesdays, which has been the case throughout virtual school and will continue to be the case in hybrid mode. Though hybrid school starts in a week, no one knows what cohort they belong to. Evidentially, communication is not Seattle Public Schools' strong suit. Oh well, right?""

On Wednesday, 24 March 2021, I did<strong> my third stint of volunteering at a local Covid vaccination centre</strong> - and got<strong> my own first vaccination</strong> at the same time, right in the middle of my volunteering shift.<strong> It was so uplifting!</strong> Everyone there was in my own age cohort, as they roll out the vaccine by age group - but also, because I was in a local vaccination centre, I met so many people that I knew as they came in for their own vaccination appointments. Within 40 minutes of ushering people to vaccinators (NHS - National Health Service - nurses and the Army were both giving vaccinations), I had met four people I knew - two friends and two of my grown children's former teachers.

When it was time for my own vaccination, I was made to feel like a poster child for the entire programme - someone had to fill in for me for ten minutes while I stood in the queue, all the other marshalls laughed and joked with me as they gave me the necessary information, and half a dozen NHS staff all exclaimed, ""You should have told us you had your vaccination letter, we'd have slipped you in earlier!"" When it was done I went straight back to marshalling.

<strong> I am an American ex-pat living in Scotland</strong>; I have had dual citizenship since 2016.<strong> My heart absolutely swells with pride to see how my adopted country is rising to the challenge</strong> of vaccinating its people, and<strong> to be able to help out with that a little bit.</strong>",2021-03-26 20:05:01,true,2021-03-29 00:12:51.391445,en,PJP_1523_1_EN_week17_journal_1_ptext.jpg

NINE MONTHS of heartrending caution, the good news about the vaccine, and then - hours later - the news that he'd tested positive.</strong>

Honestly, this indifferent impersonal web diary is no medium to convey the level of irony - my brother's terrible head injury in a car accident over forty years ago, his inability to move or communicate except by pointing at letters on a board, his intact sense of humour and his memory of life before the accident, his six-month battle with pneumonia two years ago, our weekly skype and zoom calls over the past five years despite the 3500 miles between us, and now this?

He is asymptomatic at the moment.<strong> Discouraged and afraid, I went flying with my husband in a Cessna 172 this evening. He and I are both licensed private pilots. The small airport where we hire planes shut down at 5 p.m. this evening</strong> for Christmas, and will remain closed for the hard lockdown beginning on 26 December 2020 in the UK, and<strong> when it opens again it will be after Brexit, when our European licenses will no longer be valid</strong> because there is no plan in place for pilots' licensing. Our flight was the last of the day, of the year, of an era.

<strong> I nearly didn't want to come - but I am so glad I did. It was SO BEAUTIFUL!</strong> The sky was clear but wreathed with wisps of cloud; the sun went down in flaming reds; the lights came on in our own beautiful city as we came home. We flew from Perth to Dundee, crossed the Kingdom of Fife at St. Andrew's, crossed the Firth of Forth and flew over Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh, and then back across the Forth where the three beautiful bridges of three centuries come together. And so back to Perth. And it was impossible to feel anything other than lucky, fortunate, blessed, to be able to see this beauty in a time of crisis and sadness, to have the gift of flight at my fingertips.

<strong> This is what you get, I tell myself. Be glad for what you get. You are so much more fortunate than so many others.</strong>

true,true,photo_and_text,"Has the pandemic affected your religious or spiritual observance in any way? If so, talk about it.","<strong>My husband and I ring the church bells at an ancient Scottish cathedral.</strong> (The six bells there are hung so that their ropes fall in a circle and can be made to sound in mathematical sequences known as ""change ringing."") My husband is the ""steeplekeeper,"" in charge of making sure that the bells and their fixtures are in sound condition.<strong> Although all bell ringing stopped during the first pandemic lockdown of 2020, we made a trip to the cathedral in June 2020 to check that all was well in the bell tower</strong> - mainly a matter of looking for unwanted birds' nests among the bells.

The churchyard had been locked up against visitors (the cathedral is a historic monument) and when we arrived, the usually well-groomed lawn was a sea of long grass. It seemed eerie and otherworldly - as if the cathedral and all its life had slipped into an enchanted sleep like the briar wood of Sleeping Beauty.

<strong>But the heart of our Church of Scotland (Presbyterian) community is really its minister, and he had very effectively moved his services online,</strong> integrating live appearances in the church with recordings that the choir made via Zoom. He's done this all year, holding his community together and receiving more online views than he ever had church attendance!

<strong>My husband and I are not really churchgoers, though in happier times we ring for the service every Sunday, and for weddings all year. This year, when our lockdown eased, we began Sunday ringing again with socially distanced measures in place.</strong> And - perhaps because it was such an effort making a 30 mile round-trip to the cathedral and ringing for only twenty minutes - we started attending the socially-distanced church services.

<strong>This hour-long pause among other people in a long slog of frantic routine with limited contacts seemed an affirmation of life and the spirit of humanity. </strong>It helps that our minister preaches a very good sermon, full of humour and a sense of connection to the world.<strong> I still keep my spirituality very private, but I realize how much I miss - and really enjoy - that PAUSE,</strong> the moment when you can put everything else aside to look inward and upward.

<strong>Now we are in another hard lockdown.</strong> The cathedral was shut for services just before Christmas. The last time the cathedral was used in practice was when my husband and I, with another bell-ringing couple, pealed out the old bells for twenty minutes on Christmas morning: an affirmation of the human spirit and our connection to God.

<strong>When the current lockdown ends, we will ring the bells again.</strong>",2021-01-24 11:04:44,true,2021-01-24 15:28:30.123234,en,PJP_1523_1_EN_week8_journal_2_ptext.JPG

Given COVID, we're not having a service, and it's winter</strong> and I certainly don't want to even go get a drink inside, much less have dinner with a friend. So<strong> I guess there's nothing else to do but for people to send flowers. The house has become a funeral parlor of flower arrangements.</strong>

<strong> And, I have to say, having a ""send flowers"" mentality myself, it's made me rethink what to do for people who are grieving.</strong> While the flowers are beautiful, and thoughtful and truly mean a lot to receive, after the 8th arrangement arrived, I almost cried because I couldn't take it any more. I was internally screaming ""please stop,"" then kicking myself for being irritated instead of thankful that I have people who love me and want to send their condolences. I wasn't sure at first if it was the amount, and not having any more space for them, as they kept coming, particularly because the house's free spaces were occupied by Christmas decorations.

But then<strong> I realized what was getting me down.Having flowers is something I actually LOVE</strong>, and it's the reason I've transformed are yard into vast perennial and annual cutting gardens.<strong> But in my grief (and clearly off the charts irritability) they represented something else I had to nurture, another reason I couldn't just let things go and grieve.</strong> I was in the middle of selling my other house, loads of details, I am the primary cook, shopper, cleaner, list maker, accountant and property manager for this house. <strong> When things arrived that I had to tend to, it was just too much. For chrissakes I lost control of details for a single day and I got a late fee on my credit card. It was due the 18th and mom died the 17th.</strong> I let things go FOR A DAY and I'm nearly $100 in the hole because of it. That hasn't happened since I was a poor young teacher.

<strong> Another thing. Flowers also die - slowly; is that the message we want to remind the grieving of?</strong> I mean, seriously. It doesn't feel like we've thought this thing through!! I can tell you, it has not been enjoyable or comforting to change water, add food, cut stems, pick out dead stuff, and, watch these gorgeous bouquets shrivel and die stem by stem.

<strong> From now on, I'm sending food. This is my solemn vow</strong> to my loved ones who may experience grief in the future: will make and bring you or send you food.<strong> The grieving need crocks of pulled pork, pans of enchiladas, lasagne, cheese plates, bagels and babkas!

We were so shocked, and scared, and angry, especially because we've been incredibly diligent for so long</strong>. But COVID found us anyway. We are very, very grateful that their symptoms are mild to moderate. It could be so much worse.

<strong> Months ago I'd assembled a ""Kovid Kit"" in a giant baggie, with a thermometer, pulse oximeter, Tylenol, Kleenex, masks, and phone charger</strong>. I was glad to be able to just throw the bag across the room. But<strong> it never occurred to me that I'd need more than one kit.</strong>

I had two years to imagine what this would be like. But I never did. I think I'd assumed that with masks, vaccines, and lockdowns we'd be safe. But here we are, and <strong> I'm surprised at how unprepared I am, despite my ""kit.""</strong>

Like, I didn't know that my insurance will pay for 8 home tests, per month, per person. Now I know, but I can't find them anywhere. I was also completely in the dark about anti-virals. We don't have a primary care doctor, and none of the test-and-treat pharmacies here offer tele-health. And it seemed hard to believe that they'd want people infected with COVID to show up in person. It took me two days and $50 to find a ""Doctor on Demand"" tele-health that would prescribe.

In the distance a tall black walnut tree,

an eclipse of her former self. Her branches,

darkened by fire, reach toward Venus and

the moon glowing luminescent.

We approach with trepidation and the burden

of farewell. Tomorrow brings sunrise,

chainsaws, and men who may or may not

appreciate she is Malka,* supreme in her realm.

Sitting on the ground beneath her once verdant

beauty, our mouths hold words, splendid jewels

of love rendered into poems to surround her,

a blanket shimmering with silver and gold threads.

In the moonlight we reach arms around her trunk,

hold strong to who she was as Malka:  A haven for

birds nesting, boys climbing, small rabbits shading.

Nothing left to say but farewell and thank you

for the hundred years of your presence.

We arrived here in the Berkshires a few days for our first real vacation since Covid struck. It is beautiful and wonderful to be somewhere different!

I’ve chosen to believe that these employees are fully vaccinated, and our following the advice of the science and medical professionals who keep telling us that fully vaxxed folks can skip the masks! In the past few days, we’ve gone into many smaller shops that cater to the tourists and there also, most of the staff aren’t masked and many of the customers aren’t either. At the restaurants, staff are masked, but diners aren’t. And outside, most people aren’t wearing masks, but some are, especially pre-teens. It is<strong> a real hodge-lodge of rules and behaviors.</strong> We went into the public library and there a sign was posted that said masks were still required in government buildings. As we walked through the neighborhood of our rental home, we passed many people - no masks at all.

Mostly, though, people seem happy and are glad to see others. The store owners are thrilled to have people coming into their stores again. “Help Wanted” signs compete with all the new signage about masks!

June 9. Masks worn outdoors seem to be a thing of the past here. Walking to buy vegetables yesterday, I was the only person I saw masked. Even in the outdoor Turkish market, where they are still formally required, i saw more mouths than I did a month ago. (It’s interesting that the mouths of strangers have become a source of alarm.)

<strong> I invited a senior colleague I like very much who is quarantining in Berlin to socially distant tea in a park</strong>. (She hasn’t replied, and I worry I was too forward.)

<strong> Her quarantine is required because she flew in from the UK. The Delta variant is proving to be a serious contender there</strong>, despite their high vaccination rates. So Germany and France have put in travel bans</strong>. She herself is a German citizen, here to see her sibling’s newborn, so she was allowed in.<strong> She said it was heartbreaking seeing people turned away at the gate.</strong>

<strong> The decision to shove Brexit through during the pandemic—« hard to understand » is the most restrained thing I can say about it.</strong>

Germany trying to keep the Delta variant from getting up a head of steam here is understandable, though. They have half the vaccinated pop that the UK has, even if they are using Pfizer more than the less effective AstraZeneca.

<strong> Berlin Cafes have opened outdoor seating, and no longer require you to present a negative COVID test to sit down.</strong> There are still pop -up Covid testing places everywhere—if you aren’t vaccinated, which is still most people, a negative test lets you dine indoors, or go to the gym, or even (!) go to the opera. Out walking<strong> I’ve seen a pop-up testing center in a lovely tent, out of the back of a car, at a stand that looked like a water ice stand in the park, and in several storefronts.</strong> Rapid tests have been available from Gorillas,, the grocery delivery company, for some time. I think it’s terrific. <strong> A few months ago it was impossible to get a test without potentially exposing yourself to COVID-19</strong> in the process– you could only get them done at a doctor’s office or in testing centers with very long lines. So you didn’t get tested unless for some reason you absolutely had to. I have a PCR test I ordered from Amazon when they were briefly available for something like 80 euro before they sold out, which I hung on to anxiously all winter in case I had to fly back. It was priceless then. Now, I hope, it’s nearly valueless, and can gather dust in the bathtub with the rest of my emergency stores.

true,true,photo_and_text,"Talk about your current living situation. Has anything changed during the pandemic (for example, where you're living, who you're living with, etc.).
","<strong> My living situation has changed many times throughout the pandemic.</strong> When it all started, I was the only one of my siblings at home with my parents. My sister was in her junior year of college, and my brother had just finished studying [in] Boulder. I remember the day before spring break started, my school decided to have a day off to decide what would happen if the pandemic progressed in United States. My senior exchange trip to Spain had just been cancelled and I was feeling a bit bored. I remember that Monday we got news that both my sister and cousin's schools had been cancelled. .... <strong> It was very interesting to go from being the only child at home to having to share it with my sister and my cousin.</strong> While my cousin and I have always gotten along really well, we had never spent so much time together. It turns out, while me and my cousin get along well, we do not always get along so well with my sister (as we are both a bit more messy and disorganized, and she is a person who very much likes control, any control), so that created a very interesting dynamic within the house.<strong> We made it through it though and have lots of fond memories.</strong>

<strong> My living situation changed once again when I started my first year of college. ... this was the first time in a really long time that I had to share a room. I was so nervous about that, but my roommate and I clicked from day one.</strong> She became my closest confidant, she was the only person I had trusted to tell about my decision to apply to different school, as we had other previous conversations in which we talked about all the reasons we were unhappy and exactly how much we want to transfer (though we were being quite dramatic)<strong>. Our room ended up being a really happy place for me. We had LED lights that went all around the room and they could change to any color we wanted.</strong> We also had Christmas lights up all year round which made it super cozy. Our room had a light pink and light yellow theme that reminded me of the desert, so <strong> when I saw this awesome cactus light (picture above) I knew it would be the perfect addition to our room.</strong> While for all of December we were at home, we decided to decorate our room early for Christmas to help us push through the last bit of November. I decided to decorate the cactus light with more tiny Christmas lights and I remember having such a good laugh about it as we listened to some Christmas music one night.

<strong> My living situation changed one more time when I transferred.</strong> This year I am living in a single room, which wasn't my first choice. I am a people person and I really like being around other people, so I was hoping for a roommate. However, I will say,<strong> after living in a house full of people, and sharing a college dorm the size of a shoebox, it is nice to have my own space.</strong>",2021-10-16 20:44:49,true,2021-10-19 15:01:22.638599,en,PJP_2537_1_EN_week7_journal_2_ptext.jpeg

Since I'm immunocompromised and can't really return to normal the way most people seem to be doing now in the wake of Omicron, and since I've spent most of my life since early March 2020 isolating, they've provided me with many and comfort. They've given me something to do each day, to take care of and be responsible for, kept me on track and going even when all I wanted to do for depressing, lonely week after week, month after month, is lay on the couch and be as invisible as I've felt through the pandemic</strong>. They make me smile, they bring me joy, they're always there. In a time of upheaval and disruption in my personal, professional, and social life, as the world becomes more inaccessible and farther away, as the people I care for drop out of my life, I've been able to count on them each and every day.

<strong> Now, my oldest girl is slowly slipping away.

I've seen my friends' kids born and grow up, go off to college, get jobs, become parents themselves. I lost all of my grandparents after her arrival. She was there when their home was sold before they moved into retirement housing and I lost access to the place in the world that brought me the most comfort. But she was still there, curled on my lap or on her favorite green cushion that I always have on a chair in the window so she can catch the warm rays of sunshine whether it's the dead of winter or the height of summer.

<strong> I've lost a great deal over my life, especially during these COVID years. But I've had her. My best friend. Not for much longer, though, and I am devastated. Lost.

true,true,photo_and_text,"How is the coronavirus pandemic affecting your life right now? Tell us about your experiences, feelings, and thoughts.","<strong> Looking back at my previous journals, it seems that I often wrote about how uncertain COVID-19 has made the future</strong>. Shifting regulations, new variants, and the possibility of lockdowns constantly loom at the back of my mind. Accordingly,<strong> this past week reminded me of how variable things are.</strong> Because [our college] community has been experiencing a spike in cases,<strong> all of campus has had to go back to masking indoors with protective KN95s through the end of classes. We almost made it to four mask-free weeks</strong>, but the inevitability that cases would keep increasing made that impossible.<strong> While reactions around campus are mixed, I do not have strong feelings one way or another</strong>. Honestly, I knew indoor masking could be a possibility again, and while I am a bit annoyed at having to readjust to breathing through a mask, I can handle a couple weeks of mask wearing if it means other campus activities, like outdoor festivals, remain open.

One thing different this time around is the weather.<strong> Spring is here</strong>, which means days have been sunnier and temperatures have been warmer. <strong> Last week, I spent a lot of my time searching for new outdoor study spots and soaking up some sun</strong> for the first time since October. I even had a couple classes outside (hint: the anthropology class I am writing this journal for) and felt so much more mentally refreshed than I usually do after spending my time sitting indoors. Being able to spend more time outdoors, I also think it will be easier to adjust to mask wearing. During the winter, I felt like we all curled up into our own little bubbles and hid behind our hats, coats, and masks, so hopefully now we can use the warmer weather as an opportunity to maintain connections with others despite having to mask.<strong> I am eager to see how we all practice mask wearing in a new seasonal context, especially having already experienced waves of regulations in the past.</strong>

With all that is happening locally and globally</strong>–easing restrictions on campus, a national decline in cases, large-scale crises like Putin’s invasion of Ukraine– hearing the word “covid” has started to leave me with an apathetic expression. Although I have heard utterances of another simmering variant, it seems like a given at this point–covid will continue to wax and wane, cases will drop and spike, and we will all just have to carry on and adapt as we have been the past two years.

<strong> Ironically, I am sick right now with some other virus; you forget that other viruses besides COVID-19 still exist.</strong> Even more ironically, I fully departed from wearing masks indoors this past week, which may explain my newfound sickness. Do I blame the sudden absence of indoor mask regulations or plain bad luck? Part of me wants to retreat back to mask wearing as I sit here with a burning sore throat, but I have to keep reminding my hypochondriac self that masks are not the norm and not a safety blanket, either.

Our school organized our quarantine to be in on-campus apartments which are for upper-classman.
